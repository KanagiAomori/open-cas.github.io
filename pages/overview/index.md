## Introduction
Open Cache Acceleration Software (Open CAS) is an open source project encompassing block caching software libraries, adapters, tools and more.  The main goal of this cache acceleration software is to accelerate a backend block device(s) by utilizing a higher performance device(s).  

At the core of Open CAS is the Open CAS Framework (OCF). To build upon OCF and in order to provide complete caching solutions, Open CAS also provides adapter implementations for Linux operating systems and for SPDK applications.  See the sections [Open CAS Linux](/index.html#open-cas-linux) and [SPDK Block Device](/index.html#storage-performance-development-kit-ocf-block-device) below for more information.  

The figure below shows the software stack of complete caching solutions using SPDK and Open CAS Linux.

The main sub-projects of Open CAS are:
- Open CAS Framework (OCF)
- Open CAS Linux
- SPDK OCF Block Device

## Open CAS Framework (OCF)
The Open CAS Framework (OCF) is a high performance block storage caching meta-library written in C.  
OCF is the foundation which Open CAS Linux and SPDK depend on to provide complete caching solutions.

Visit the [What is OCF](ocf_intro.html) and [OCF Quick Setup](getting_started_ocf.html) pages for more information.

## Open CAS Linux
Open CAS Linux provides kernel adapters to OCF in order to implement a high performance, low latency complete caching solution for Linux operating systems.  
The picture below depicts in green the integration of OCF and the implemented kernel adapters provided with Open CAS Linux.

Visit the [Open CAS Linux Quick Setup](getting_started_open_cas_linux.html) and [Open CAS Linux Admin Guide](guide_introduction.html) pages for more information.

## Storage Performance Development Kit OCF Block Device
The Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) is a set of tools and libraries for building high performance applications.
Open CAS enhances SPDK by providing an OCF SPDK block device adapter to build high performance caching-aware applications.
The SPDK OCF block device is independent from Open CAS Linux as it implements a different type of adapter while still utilizing OCF.
The picture below depicts the integration of OCF and SPDK.

## What is OCF?
Open CAS Framework (OCF) is high performance block storage caching
meta-library written in C. It's entirely platform and system independent,
accessing system API through user provided environment wrappers layer.
OCF tightly integrates with the rest of software stack, providing flawless,
high performance, low latency caching utility.

## What's in it for me?
For short - performance. OCF enables easy block cache deployment for any
performance sensitive application that works with huge data sets stored
on persistent memory. It was primarily designed to cache data from HDD
drives on SSDs, but it also can be used for caching data from QLC SSD on
TLC SSD, Optane drives, RAM memory, or any combination of above including
all kinds of multilevel configurations.

## Who already uses OCF?
Open CAS Framework is heart of two established caching products:
- Intel &reg; Cache Acceleration Software for Linux
- Intel &reg; Cache Acceleration Software for QEMU

We are also default caching solution for
[Storage Performance Development Kit](https://spdk.io/) (starting from
version 19.01).

## Who contributes to OCF?
Our open source community is still forming and we are very positive about
that. OCF is mostly developed and maintained by Intel. We are the team who
developed OCF (as a part of Cache Acceleration Software) for many years.
Now we are very extited about undergoing transition to truely open source
project. We are open for contributions of any kind. If you feel like helping
us make OCF better, take a look at [Contributing](contributing.html) page.

## How do I get it?
We are fully open source. Visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-CAS/ocf) page.
